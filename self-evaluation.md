# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  - I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the `each` method iterates my code through each element in an array.


- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  - I really enjoyed this challenge, I tried to problem solve a bit on my own and use the knowledge I already had to try and predict how I could do things like check if the first letter was "P". Fortunately I figured it out before I got frustrated, so it was a productive struggle. I did attempt googling at one point and got frustrated because I could not word my question well enough to get relative answers.


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I really need to work on my commits, I almost forgot to make any commits again today. But, on the bright side i did remember to name my first commit "Initial commit" !


- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - I was a little confused as to why when you are trying to determine if the first letter is P, it does not need to be in in quotations like a string. I figured that P alone is not a data type and I would have to make it a string, but that threw an error! I am not sure how to google that so I will probably ask Amy...
